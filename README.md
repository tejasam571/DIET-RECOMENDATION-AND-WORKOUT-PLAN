## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diet-recommendation-workout-plan.git
   cd diet-recommendation-workout-plan
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset:
     ```bash
     python src/data_preprocessing.py
     ```

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train the machine learning model using the following command:
     ```bash
     python src/model.py
     ```

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance:
     ```bash
     python src/evaluation.py
     ```

4. **Generate Recommendations**:
   - Use the trained model to generate personalized diet and workout plans:
     ```bash
     python src/recommendation.py
     ```

## Dataset

- The dataset used in this project consists of [briefly describe the dataset, e.g., user demographics, dietary preferences, workout history, etc.].
- It can be found [mention where the dataset can be accessed or if it is provided in the repository].

## Model Training

- The model is trained using [mention the algorithms used, e.g., decision trees, random forest, neural networks, etc.].
- Training involves [briefly describe the training process, e.g., feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, etc.].

## Evaluation

- The model's performance is evaluated using [mention metrics, e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.].
- Results and evaluation metrics are stored in the `output/results` directory.

## Results

- [Provide a summary of the results obtained from the model evaluation, including any graphs or tables generated.]
